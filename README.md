# Tic-tac-toe-game
Practice at building a simple game of tic tac toe that will vet and accept inputs, display a simple game board, and check for win conditions

11/4/21 - I have finished making the game and worked out any bugs I could think of :) Now I just need to run it by somebody with experience to see what I could do better or more efficiently
